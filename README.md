# Overview

Blinking LED from scratch in Assembly/C using STM32F446 Nucelo-64 board.

Flashing the board requires [https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink], an open-source implementation of the st-link tool from STMicroelectronics.

This tool also implements a GDB server allowing debugging over SWD/JTAG.
